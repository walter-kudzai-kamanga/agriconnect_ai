AgriConnect AI – Farm-to-Market Logistics Intelligence Platform

 Problem Statement

Across Africa, smallholder farmers lose around30–50% of their produce  due to poor access to affordable, reliable transport. Trucks often return empty, while nearby farmers struggle to get their harvest to markets.

Consequences:

* Food spoilage
* Reduced farmer income
* Inefficient use of transport resources
* Limited economic growth in rural communities



 Objectives

1. Connect smallholder farmers to available transporters in real-time.
2. Optimize delivery routes to reduce spoilage and cost.
3. Provide market insights best prices, nearby demand, predicted arrival times.
4. Support voice and text interaction in local languages.
5. Demonstrate multi-context AI reasoning via MCP: transport, weather, and market data fused intelligently.



Target Users

* Primary -  Smallholder farmers in rural Africa
* Secondary - Transport operators (trucks, vans, local couriers)
* Tertiary - Market traders, agricultural cooperatives, NGOs





MCP AI Architecture

 Description

1. Input Layer

   * Farmer data (voice/text, crop type, quantity, location)
   * Transporter data (GPS, vehicle capacity, availability)
   * Market data (prices, demand, location)
   * Environmental data (weather, road conditions)

2. MCP Context Integration

   * AI agent fuses all inputs into  single contextual reasoning layer
   * Generates delivery matches, optimal routes, and predicted delivery times

3. Decision Engine

   * Predicts best transport match and route
   * Generates alerts (delays, spoilage risk)
   * Updates dashboard and notifications

4. Output Layer

   * Farmer app (mobile / SMS / voice)
   * Transporter app (mobile / dashboard)
   * Admin dashboard (for NGOs or cooperatives)



Storyboard

1.Step 1 -  Farmer opens the app, inputs crop (e.g., tomatoes), quantity, and location via voice or text.
2. Step 2 - MCP agent retrieves nearby available transporters, road conditions, weather forecasts, and market demand.
3. Step 3 - AI recommends optimal transport match and delivery route; sends notification to farmer and transporter.
4. Step 4 -  Dashboard shows live status: “Truck #3 is picking up 500kg tomatoes, expected arrival in 2h at Mbare Musika.”
5. Step 5 -  Farmer receives confirmation + market price estimate. Optionally, transporter can update progress via app/SMS.

Visual Demo - Map with moving vehicle icons, farmer input screen, alerts in local language.


if time permits am to add

* Add predictive spoilage modeling — AI predicts risk if delays occur.
* Add market price forecasting for next 3 days using historical data.
* Include  offline mode -  allow farmers to submit orders even without internet; AI processes later.
* Integrate voice-based commands in 2–3 local languages.




could start building:

* Flutter app MVP - for farmer + transporter
* Backend + MCP agent - for matching + route optimization
* Demo dashboard for live visualization
